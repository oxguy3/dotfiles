# scripts/sounds
Some stupid sound effects to use for notifications when a script finishes or just for goofing around.

Normally I'm very careful about licensing and not using anything that I don't strictly have permission to use. But uh, for these sound effects, I don't think I'm ever gonna get explicit permission (and frankly, most of them are probably short enough for me to reasonably safe under _[de minimis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis)_ doctrine). Nonetheless, if you take any issue with me distributing any of these files, tweet me [@oxguy3](https://twitter.com/oxguy3) or email me at haydenschiff _at_ gmail _dot_ com, and I'll remove them immediately (please, no need for lawyers or DMCA takedowns, I mean no harm!).
